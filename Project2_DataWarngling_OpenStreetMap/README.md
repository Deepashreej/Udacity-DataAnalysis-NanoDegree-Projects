Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data

Downloaded a dataset from OpenStreetMap and used data wrangling techniques to assess the quality of the data and make improvements where necessary. 
The data was then loaded into SQL database and queried to discover insights.

This project demonstrates the following steps:

Assess the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity
Parse and gather data from popular file formats such as .json, .xml, .csv, .html
Process data from many files and very large files that can be cleaned with spreadsheet programs
Learn how to store, query, and aggregate data using SQL
