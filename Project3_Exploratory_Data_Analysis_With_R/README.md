### RED WINE ANALYSIS USING R

Downloaded a tidy data set containing 1,599 red wines with 11 variables on the chemical properties of the wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).
Explored and analysed the data through various statistical visualizations using the R language. The goal of this analysis was to discover which chemical properties influence the quality of red wines.

Sections of univariate, bi-variate and multi variate analysis were graphically shown making use of the following R libraries:
* library(ggplot2)
* library(dplyr)
* library(GGally)
* library(scales)
* library(memisc)
* library(reshape)
* library(gridExtra)
* library(RColorBrewer)

Functions like geom_boxplot(), grid.arrange(), cor() were some of the many functions used in this interesting analysis.

As a result of this analysis we found that higher alcohol, Sulphates, Citric acid with lower Volatile Acidity and pH constitutes to a better quality wine. 

It was fun to explore data of Red wines as I also learnt about the process of making wine through internet on discovering the knowledge on many variables of the data set.
