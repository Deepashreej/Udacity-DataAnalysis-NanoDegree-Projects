Introduction:

This project is an investigation of the Titanic passenger dataset using NumPy and Pandas. It illustrates the entire data analysis process, from posing the relevant questions to finishing by sharing my findings on the same.

Python language with numpy and panda classes are extensively used to calculate the satistical data and to visualize the finding graphically.

Install:
This project requires Python 2.7 and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy
Pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an iPython Notebook

Udacity recommends our students install Anaconda, a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

Code:
Template code is provided in the notebook Investigating the Dataset Titanic.ipynb notebook file. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project.

Run:
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory Project1_Titanic_Investigating_DataSet/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

jupyter notebook Investigating the Dataset Titanic.ipynb
or

ipython notebook Investigating the Dataset Titanic.ipynb

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your web browser.

Data:
The dataset used in this project is included as titanic_data.csv. This dataset is provided by Udacity and contains the following attributes:

survival : Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
pclass : Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)
name : Name
sex : Sex
age : Age
sibsp : Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard
parch : Number of Parents/Children Aboard
ticket : Ticket Number
fare : Passenger Fare
cabin : Cabin
embarked : Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
