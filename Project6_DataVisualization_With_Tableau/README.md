### ABOUT:
The data set used in this self explanatory visualizations contains 1,157 baseball players' performance records. It includes their handedness (right, left handed or both), height (in inches), weight (in pounds), batting average, and home runs. The visualizations convey the differences in the performances of the players depending on their handedness and compares how their Body Mass Indices contributes to the performances measured in terms of Home Runs and Batting Average.

The Tableau story has been improvised over several feedbacks from raw audience in terms of better understandability of the statistical terms used and easy readability of the visualisations of the data analysis made in this project.
